Version 1.0.5 --- 15.02.2011@01:55
Improved the layout/blocks implementation. Blocks can now call children in their
main blocks. Children are properly referenced by name now. You cannot call child blocks
if they don't belong to the calling parent.
Added the methods:
 - setTemplate: to set a template for the current block
 - unsetChild: to remove the child from the current block
Sample usage:
<reference name="right">
	<action method="setTemplate"><template>page/right.php</template></action>
	<action method="unsetChild"><name>menu</name></action>
</reference>
Would set the template "page/right.php" to the "right" block, and after that we
would remove the child "menu" for the "right" block.

Version 1.0.4 --- 14.02.2011@03:26
Added a basic implementation for the layout structure, supporting blocks for the design
similar to the Magento layout/blocks architecture. Works quite well, I can't believe it.

Version 1.0.3 --- 11.02.2011@01:22
Added a basic implementation of a profiler, for CPU and MEMORY usage
Started to build a basic theme support for the introductory package and the future backend interface

Version 1.0.2 --- 10.02.2011@01:12
Added a basic implementation of field validators and a base class for model resources

Each model resource is defined in an xml file with the same name as the model; eg: model user.php would have it's fields defined in user.xml

Version 1.0.1 --- Second release
