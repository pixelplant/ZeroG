When you first install ZeroG:

1) Rewrites
----------
If rewrites do not work, make sure the module mod_rewrite is installed and
enabled for Apache.
Create an empty php file, add these lines:
<?php
phpinfo();
?>
Run the file and search for the text 'mod_rewrite'
If it's missing, mod_rewrite is not enabled.
Enable it in httpd.conf by uncommenting the line '#LoadModule mod_rewrite'
(if the line is present, of course)
----------
If the rewrite rules still do not work...
The rewrite rules are defined in .htaccess (ZeroG\.htaccess)
Make sure in httpd.conf or whatever your Apache's configuration file is called
that for your directory where you run the project 'AllowOverride' is set to 'All'
and not 'None'.
----------
The rewriting is enabled/disabled in app/etc/local.xml
=> config/global/default/url/rewrite
Set this XML node to FALSE if you do not want or cannot get rewrites to work.
